## Hi there, I'm Pedro Vitor! ğŸ‘‹


**Peruvitu/Peruvitu** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my own agency of design
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning development skills, focused on games
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on games
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with recruitment
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about game development
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: pvfariacode@gmail.com
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I rarely cry, unless I watch Violet Evergarden.
